        <p>Hello! My name is Rodrigo and I am from Canoas, Brazil. I am a manager at a bank and professionally dedicated to the financial sector. However, my life goes beyond spreadsheets and reports. I am someone who prioritizes family time above all else.
            Outside of the corporate environment, I find great satisfaction in diving into the world of online gaming. The competition and strategy of these games protect me from moments of tension and challenge.
            Furthermore, I am a cinema and series enthusiast. Finding a good movie to watch or catching up on a captivating series is one of my favorite ways to relax and disconnect from work.</p>
