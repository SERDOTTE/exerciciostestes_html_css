                    <h1>Rodrigo Serdotte Freitas | WDD 130</h1>
                    <p>Hello! My name is Rodrigo and I am from Canoas, Brazil. I am a manager at a bank and professionally dedicated to the financial sector. However, my life goes beyond spreadsheets and reports. I am someone who prioritizes family time above all else.
                    Outside of the corporate environment, I find great satisfaction in diving into the world of online gaming. The competition and strategy of these games protect me from moments of tension and challenge.
                    Furthermore, I am a cinema and series enthusiast. Finding a good movie to watch or catching up on a captivating series is one of my favorite ways to relax and disconnect from work.</p>

            <img src="images/riograndedosul.jpg" alt="Rio Grande do Sul">
            <p>Rio Grande do Sul, a state in southern Brazil, stands out for its geographical diversity, varied climates, and diversified economy. Recognized for agricultural production, livestock farming, and viticulture, the state also preserves strong GaÃºcho cultural traditions, such as barbecue and mate tea, and hosts events and festivals celebrating its music and art.</p>
            <p>The culture of Rio Grande do Sul, the southernmost state in Brazil, is distinct and rich, reflecting a blend of influences from indigenous peoples, Portuguese settlers, and later immigrants from various parts of Europe, particularly Italy and Germany.</p>
            <p>A key element of Rio Grande do Sul's culture is the "gaucho" tradition, akin to the cowboy culture of North America. Gauchos are skilled horsemen and cattle herders, known for their distinctive attire, including bombachas (baggy trousers), wide-brimmed hats, and boots. The gaucho lifestyle is celebrated through music, dance, and festivals. </p>
